Stack
-----
A data collection based on last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle.

- Stack items are iterated in reverse order of being added
- Useful for reversing items in a collection without advance knowledge of total number
- Stack operations:
  - push()
  - pop()
  - isEmpty()
  - size()
 
Queue
-----
A data collection based on first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. Very similar methods to 
stack but:

- Data items are operated on in same order as received
- Queue operations:
  - enqueue() - add an item to end
  - dequeue() - remove oldest item
  - isEmpty()
  - size()
