**Class Details**

* Location: IB 3406
* Time: Tues 6:00 - 8:40 pm
* Dates:  01/02/2019 - 03/22/2019
* Credits: 5
* Prerequisites: AD 300 or similar with 2.5 or better
* Instructor: Brenden West | brenden.west@seattlecolleges.edu | 206-552-9795

**Summary** 
This class covers fundamental data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques at the core of computer science. Students will learn how to estimate theoretical performance of a programmatic solution and choose optimal solutions for common programming problems.

Includes linked lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, binary and multi-way trees, directed graphs, hashing, and sorting. 

**Class Structure and Topics**
Each week's class will involve lecture on a new topic and time to practice what we've learned or to work through assignments. This course will cover the following topics, although the precise list & order is subject to revision:

* Analysis of Algorithms
* Linked lists
* Abstract Data Types 
* Stacks & Queues
* Sorting algorithms
* Hashing
* Binary search trees
* Balanced B-trees
* Hash Tables
* Graphs and path finding
* String algorithms & regular expressions
* Compression algorithms
 
**Course Materials**
Assigned readings and exercises will draw from Algorithms, 4th Ed and the associated online courses at:

* https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1 
* https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2  

Optional readings will also draw from "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 2nd Edition", which is available free online through Seattle Public Library.

Programming exercises will also be drawn from these free online services:

* https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/ 
* https://leetcode.com/ 

Students will need a computer with an IntelliJ-based Java programming environment as described for Windows or Mac OSX.

Grading
Grades will be based on assignments & exercises (85%), and the quizzes (15%). There is no final exam.

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Smaller coding assignments are due by the start of class on the following Tuesday and late submission may be marked down by 10%. 

Larger programming assignments are due by finals week, but have a suggested due date that students should target to avoid a time crunch & knowledge gaps for subsequent assignments. Grade for these assignments is a weighted value based on your Coursera.org score (80% passing score = full credit).

You may discuss how to approach solutions with other students in the class or in online forums, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty. 

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit.
